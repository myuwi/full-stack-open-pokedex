In Rust, the tools for linting, testing, and building are all included in the Cargo toolchain. In most Rust projects, linting is done using `clippy`, as it very powerful, and it is the officially supported linter. For testing, Cargo provides the `cargo test` command, which can be used to run unit and integrations tests built using Rust's built-in testing framework. Similarly, builds in Rust are handled using the `cargo build` command, which will handle building the application. In general, Rust's first party tooling is a breeze to work with compared to JavaScript's very fragmented tooling ecosystem.

There are a multitude of CI setups other than Jenkins and GitHub Actions, but some common ones include: GitLab CI/CD, TeamCity, BitBucket Pipelines, and Azure Pipelines. Which one of these to choose usually depends on which ecosystem your other tooling, like your version control, belongs to.

For a team of about 6 people, a cloud-hosted setup might be more preferable, as it lets the team focus more on building the software, rather than focusing too much on managing their own DevOps infrastructure. There are of course edge cases where self-hosted could be more preferable, such as when strict security policies are to be followed, or if the required infrastructure is already in place, but in general, I would go with a cloud-based solution first, as it is generally easier to get going with which allows the team to move faster. If it is later found that a self-hosted solution is desired, the pipeline can be migrated to a self-hosted solution at a later point in time.
